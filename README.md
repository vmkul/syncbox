## What is SyncBox?
SyncBox is a file hosting service that inherits the idea of Dropbox, 
a service that brings files together in one central place by creating 
a special folder on the user's computer. The contents of these folders 
are synchronized to servers and to other computers and devices where the 
user has installed the software, keeping the same files up-to-date on all devices.
